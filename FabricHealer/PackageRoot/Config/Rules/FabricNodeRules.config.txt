## Logic rules for Service Fabric Node repairs.

## First check if we are inside the run interval. If so, cut (!).
Mitigate() :- CheckInsideRunInterval(RunInterval=02:00:00), !.

## This rule means that whatever the warning data from FabricObserver happens to be (related to node level healing repairs, of course), restart the target node if 
## the repair hasn't run 4 times in the last 8 hours.
Mitigate() :- GetRepairHistory(?repairCount, TimeWindow=8:00:00), 
	?repairCount < 4,
	RestartFabricNode().
