## Logic rules for scheduling Machine-level repair jobs in the cluster. EntityType fact is Machine.
## FH does not conduct (execute) these repairs. It simply schedules them. InfrastructureService is always the Executor for these types of Repair Jobs.

## Applicable Named Arguments for Mitigate. Facts are supplied by FabricObserver, FHProxy or FH itself.
## Any argument below with (FO/FHProxy) means that only FO or FHProxy will present the fact.
## | Argument Name             | Definition                                                             |
## |---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
## | NodeName                  | Name of the node                                                       | 
## | NodeType                  | Type of node                                                           |  
## | ErrorCode (FO/FHProxy)    | Supported Error Code emitted by caller (e.g. "FO002")                  | 
## | MetricName (FO/FHProxy)   | Name of the Metric  (e.g., CpuPercent or MemoryMB, etc.)               |   
## | MetricValue (FO/FHProxy)  | Corresponding Metric Value (e.g. "85" indicating 85% CPU usage)        | 
## | OS                        | The name of the OS where FabricHealer is running (Linux or Windows)    |
## | HealthState               | The HealthState of the target entity: Error or Warning                 |
    
## Metric Names, from FO or FHProxy.
## | Name                           |                                                                                    
## |--------------------------------|
## | ActiveTcpPorts                 |                                         
## | CpuPercent                     |    
## | EphemeralPorts                 | 
## | EphemeralPortsPercent          | 
## | MemoryMB                       | 
## | MemoryPercent                  | 
## | FileHandles (Linux-only)       | 
## | FileHandlesPercent (Linux-only)| 

## If this is what you need, then first check if we are inside the specified run interval for scheduling *any* machine-level repair for any reason. 
## Ending with a cut (!) means the goal (Mitigate) has been satisfied and Guan will immediately stop processing rules.
## Mitigate() :- CheckInsideRunInterval(02:00:00), !.

## TimeScopedScheduleRepair is an internal predicate to check for the number of times the specified machine repair action has run to completion within a supplied time window. 
## If the completed machine repair count is less then supplied value, then schedule an infrastructure repair via ScheduleMachineRepair predicate.
TimeScopedScheduleRepair(?count, ?time, ?repairAction) :- GetRepairHistory(?repairCount, ?time), ?repairCount < ?count, ScheduleMachineRepair(?repairAction).

## Metric-defined machine repair scheduling.

## Percent Memory in Use (of total physical).
Mitigate(MetricName=MemoryPercent, MetricValue=?MetricValue) :- ?MetricValue >= 95,
  GetHealthEventHistory(?HealthEventCount, 00:15:00), ?HealthEventCount >= 3,
  TimeScopedScheduleRepair(4, 08:00:00, System.Reboot).

## File Handles/FDs. Linux-only.

## Percent Allocated, System-wide.
Mitigate(MetricName=FileHandlesPercent, MetricValue=?MetricValue, OS=Linux) :- ?MetricValue >= 95,
  GetHealthEventHistory(?HealthEventCount, 00:15:00), ?HealthEventCount >= 3,
  TimeScopedScheduleRepair(2, 08:00:00, System.Reboot).

## Total Allocated, System-wide.
Mitigate(MetricName=FileHandles, MetricValue=?MetricValue, OS=Linux) :- ?MetricValue >= 1000000,
  GetHealthEventHistory(?HealthEventCount, 00:15:00), ?HealthEventCount >= 3,
  TimeScopedScheduleRepair(2, 08:00:00, System.Reboot).

## FH-determined machine repair scheduling. 
## This means FabricHealerManager provides the facts used here by querying HM directly, versus supplying facts from serialized TelemetryData instances created by FabricObserver or FHProxy.

## Don't proceed if the target entity is not in Error.
Mitigate(HealthState=?healthState) :- not(?healthState == Error), !.

## Don't proceed if there are 2 machine repairs currently active in the cluster.
Mitigate() :- CheckOutstandingRepairs(2), !.

## Don't proceed if the target node hasn't been in Error (including cyclic Up/Down) state for at least two hours.
Mitigate() :- CheckInsideHealthStateMinDuration(02:00:00), !.

## Don't schedule a repair if one was scheduled less than 10 minutes ago. [Do we want this account for all scheduled repairs (not just FH-scheduled)?]
Mitigate() :- CheckInsideScheduleInterval(00:10:00), !.

## Don't proceed if a node in the cluster is still in post-repair probation (so, a Completed repair, node is recovering).
Mitigate() :- CheckInsideProbationPeriod(00:30:00), !.

## Mitigations.

## Reboot.
## Don't process any other rules if scheduling succeeds or fails (note the !) and there are less than 2 of these repairs that have completed in the last 4 hours.
Mitigate() :- GetRepairHistory(?repairCount, 04:00:00, System.Reboot), ?repairCount < 2, !, ScheduleMachineRepair(System.Reboot).

## Reimage.
Mitigate() :- GetRepairHistory(?repairCount, 04:00:00, System.ReimageOS), ?repairCount < 2, !, ScheduleMachineRepair(System.ReimageOS).

## Heal.
Mitigate() :- GetRepairHistory(?repairCount, 04:00:00, System.Azure.Heal), ?repairCount < 2, !, ScheduleMachineRepair(System.Azure.Heal).

## If we end up here, then human intervention is required (Triage)..
