## Logic rules for scheduling Machine-level repair jobs in the cluster. EntityType fact is always Machine.
## FH does not conduct (execute) these repairs. It simply schedules them. InfrastructureService is always the Executor for these types of Repair Jobs.

## Applicable Named Arguments for Mitigate. Facts are supplied by FabricObserver, FHProxy or FH itself.
## Any argument below with (FO/FHProxy) means that only FO or FHProxy will present the fact.
## | Argument Name             | Definition                                                             |

## | ErrorCode (FO/FHProxy)    | Supported Error Code emitted by caller (e.g. "FO002")                  | 
## | MetricName (FO/FHProxy)   | Name of the Metric  (e.g., CpuPercent or MemoryMB, etc.)               |   
## | MetricValue (FO/FHProxy)  | Corresponding Metric Value (e.g. "85" indicating 85% CPU usage)        | 
## | OS                        | The name of the OS where FabricHealer is running (Linux or Windows)    |
## | HealthState               | The HealthState of the target entity: Error or Warning                 |
## | Source                    | The Source ID of the related SF Health Event                           | 
## | Property                  | The Property of the related SF Health Event                            |

## Metric Names, from FO or FHProxy.

## The logic program below is a repair specification (policy) that does not require facts from FabricObserver (FO) or FHProxy.
## It demonstrates a series of constraints and repair scheduling escalations.

## Don't proceed if the target entity is not in Error.
Mitigate(HealthState=?healthState) :- not(?healthState == Error), !.

## Don't proceed if there are already 2 or more machine repairs currently active in the cluster.
Mitigate() :- CheckOutstandingRepairs(2), !.

## Don't proceed if FH scheduled a machine repair less than 10 minutes ago.
Mitigate() :- CheckInsideScheduleInterval(00:10:00), !.

## Don't proceed if target node is currently inside a post-repair health probation period (post-repair means a Completed repair; target node is still recovering).
Mitigate() :- CheckInsideNodeProbationPeriod(00:30:00), !.

## Don't proceed if the target node hasn't been in Error (including cyclic Up/Down) state for at least two hours.
Mitigate() :- CheckInsideHealthStateMinDuration(02:00:00), !.

## Mitigations (RM repair scheduling logic - InfrastructureService for the target node type will be the repair Executor, not FH).
## The logic below demonstrates how to specify a repair escalation path: Reboot -> Reimage -> Heal -> Triage (human intervention required).

## Reboot.
## Don't process any other rules if scheduling succeeds OR fails (note the position of ! (cut operator)) and there are less than 2 of these repairs that have completed in the last 4 hours.
Mitigate() :- GetRepairHistory(?repairCount, 08:00:00, System.Reboot), ?repairCount < 2, !, ScheduleMachineRepair(System.Reboot).

## ReimageOS escalation.
Mitigate() :- GetRepairHistory(?repairCount, 08:00:00, System.ReimageOS), ?repairCount < 2, !, ScheduleMachineRepair(System.ReimageOS).

## Azure.Heal escalation.
Mitigate() :- GetRepairHistory(?repairCount, 08:00:00, System.Azure.Heal), ?repairCount < 2, !, ScheduleMachineRepair(System.Azure.Heal).

## Triage escalation.
## If we end up here, then human intervention is required. LogInfo will generate ETW/Telemetry/Health events containing the message.
## FabricHealer will also schedule a ManualTriageNeeded repair task. Once you manually solve the problem, then cancel this repair task as it will block any other
## repair by FabricHealer for the target node while it is not Completed. It also counts against the number of concurrent Active repairs you specified above in the
## CheckOutstandingRepairs predicate. Note: Scheduling a custom repair (ManualTriageNeeded) will block any attempts to schedule another machine repair for the target node.
Mitigate(NodeName=?nodeName) :- LogInfo("0042_{0}: Specified Machine repair escalations have been exhausted for node {0}. Human intervention is required.", ?nodeName), 
	ScheduleMachineRepair(ManualTriageNeeded).
