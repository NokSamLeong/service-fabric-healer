## Logic rules for Disk repair. Only file management is supported (file deletion).

## First, check if we are inside run interval. If so, then cut (!).
## This is commented out by default. Just uncomment and set the global run interval for disk level repairs to suit your needs.

## Mitigate() :- CheckInsideRunInterval(RunInterval=02:00:00), !.

## The sample rule below checks the folder size of SF logs, fabricobserver logs, E:\temp. If the computed size exceeds a supplied threshold, then try and delete the files in the directory. 
## The CheckFolderSize external predicate takes a folder path string argument and either a MaxFolderSizeGB or MaxFolderSizeMB argument.
## Either size arg must be supplied as a positive whole number. If the specified folder is larger than the supplied unsigned integer value for size, then the DeleteFiles external predicate will run.
## NOTE: You can supply "optional" arguments to the DeleteFiles external predicate. 
## "Optional" arguments for DeleteFiles: 
##		SortOrder - File sort order, Ascending or Descending. Defaults to Ascending (oldest to newest)).
##		MaxFilesToDelete - The maximum number of files to delete. If not specified (or 0) it will be interpreted to mean delete all files.
##		RecurseSubdirectories - Delete files in child folders of specified directory. Defaults to false if not specified.

## Iterate over a list of folders with a system predicate, member (defined and implemented in Guan) and an internal predicate, config (an internal predicate needs no backing impl, it only exists in this logic).
## You can just write a rule for each folder should you need to have MB max size values for some folders and GB max size values for others. In the case below, all values are GB so it makes sense to use enumeration for convenience.
